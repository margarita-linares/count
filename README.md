# Counter Watch

This project is a counter application for a Smartwatch developed using Dart and Flutter.

## Description

The Smartwatch Counter is a simple application that allows you to increment or decrement a counter with vertical swipe gestures. The application displays a warning message when you reach the maximum and minimum limits of the counter.

## Installation and Usage

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE.
4. Run the command `flutter run` in the terminal to compile and run the application on your device/emulator.
5. Swipe up on the screen to increment the counter.
6. Swipe down on the screen to decrement the counter.

## Technologies Used

- Dart: Programming language used to develop the application logic.
- Flutter: Framework used to build the user interface and manage the application logic.

## File Structure

- `main.dart`: Main file containing the entry point of the application.
- `counter.dart`: This is the number counter and the only page in the app.
